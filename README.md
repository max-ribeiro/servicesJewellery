# servicesJewellery
This project is a way to register the services orders from a jewellery.
When a client wants to fix a jewell in the jewellery, the user(employee) will log in the system where he will be abble to create a new 
service order, see previous registered services and register new clients to database.

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites

To run this project in development mode, you will need to set up a local server that can work with PHP and MySql. I use [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/pt_br/index.html) in my machine.
